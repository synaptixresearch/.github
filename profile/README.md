## About 🚀  
Synaptix Research is on a mission to re-imagine intelligence: moving beyond centralized AI models toward systems that learn, adapt and collaborate at the edge — across heterogeneous devices, environments and networks.  
We build architectures for **distributed machine learning**, **edge-AI optimization**, **secure federated systems**, **multi-agent coordination**, and **collective intelligence**.

## Our Projects 📦  
This organisation currently hosts three active projects. Contributions are welcome — please see the **Contributing** section below.

---

### 1. **Pyspace – Decentralized Distributed Training Framework** 🌌  
A lightweight framework designed for decentralized and federated-style distributed model training.  
It enables model training across heterogeneous edge devices.

**Key features:**
- 🧠 Central `EdgeServer` for task orchestration  
- 📱 `EdgeClient` modules for phones / IoT devices  
- ⏱️ Task scheduling & edge-optimized execution  
- 🔐 Secure multi-device coordination  
- 🤝 Large-scale collaborative learning support

### 2. **Sparse MoE LLM – Expert Distillation via Circular Learning** 🧩  
A research-driven Sparse Mixture-of-Experts model built by modifying the Owen 0.6B architecture with a custom expert-distillation pipeline.

**Key highlights:**
- 🔄 Circular-learning: teacher models generate progressively harder queries  
- 🧑‍🏫 Student/expert models fine-tuned using reasoning traces  
- 🎯 Improved efficiency, specialization, and expert quality  
- 🧬 Focus on MoE architecture, expert distillation & continuous self-evaluation

### 3. **Knob – End-to-End Machine Learning Platform** 🛠️  
A full-stack ML application enabling users to upload datasets, run automated ML workflows, and evaluate model performance through a clean and intuitive interface.

**Features:**
- 🗂️ Supports tabular + image datasets  
- 📊 Classification & regression tasks  
- 🔧 Hyperparameter tuning + automated pipelines  
- 🧪 Model evaluation & sample testing  
- 📦 Export models for deployment
