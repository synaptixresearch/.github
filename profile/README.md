## About  
Synaptix Research is on a mission to re-imagine intelligence: moving beyond centralized AI models toward systems that learn, adapt and collaborate at the edge — across heterogeneous devices, environments and networks. 
We build architectures for distributed machine learning, edge-AI optimisation, secure federated systems, multi-agent coordination and collective intelligence.

## Our Projects  
This organisation currently hosts three active projects. Contributions are welcome — please see the **Contributing** section below.

### 1. **Pyspace – Decentralized Distributed Training Framework**  
A lightweight framework designed for decentralized and federated-style distributed model training. It enables model training across heterogeneous edge devices.  
Key features:
- A central `EdgeServer` component for orchestration of tasks.
- `EdgeClient` modules to run on phones / IoT devices, enabling them to participate in collaborative learning.
- Scheduling of tasks, edge-optimised model execution, and secure multi-device coordination.
- Support for large-scale collaborative learning across edge nodes.

### 2. **Sparse MoE LLM – Expert Distillation via Circular Learning**  
A research-driven project modifying the Owen 0.6B architecture into a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, and designing a custom expert-distillation pipeline.  
Key highlights:
- Introduced a circular-learning approach: large teacher models generate progressively harder queries for expert modules.
- The student/expert models are fine-tuned using teacher-generated reasoning traces — improving efficiency, specialization and model quality.
- Focus lies at the intersection of sparse MoE architecture, expert distillation techniques and continuous self-evaluation workflows.

### 3. **Knob – End-to-End Machine Learning Platform**  
A full-stack ML application enabling users to upload datasets, run automated ML workflows, and evaluate model performance via a clean web interface.  
Functionalities include:
- Support for tabular and image datasets.
- Classification and regression tasks.
- Hyperparameter tuning and model-training pipelines.
- Model evaluation, sample testing and export for deployment.
